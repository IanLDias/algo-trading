---- Work in Progress ----

The steps below don't work. Currently in a process of reconfiguring the whole project.

1. Add config_var.py to base dir which has access_key and secret_key to binance
3. Add database.ini file in /Data
4. $ pipenv shell
5. run app.py to get ticker_list
6. run populate_tickers_db.py to get all relevant historical data
